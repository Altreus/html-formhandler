  call lookup_options even if no item
  init_values fails if you have a belongs_to relation that has a name 
       different from the column name
  refactor to handle calling form methods for validate_<fieldname> and 
       options_<fieldname> from fields (probably with coderefs)
  improve auto field support 
  investigate a Catalyst View to provide better template support (like Reaction)
  investigate other Form processing HTML generation
  improve testing of Render::Simple. Make sure all field types are handled.
  clean up DateTime fields (make consistent), better tests
  testcases for noupdate and clear flags
  look for other missing tests
  View::TT FillInForm role (check with jhannah)

bigger stuff
  field constraints
  support related rows, multiple rows
