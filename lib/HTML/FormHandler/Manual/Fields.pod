=head2 DESCRIPTION

A form's fields are created from the 'has_field' and 'field_list' definitions.
FormHandler processes the field lists and creates an array of
L<HTML::FormHandler::Field> objects. The "type" of a field
determines which field class to use. The field class determines which
attributes are valid for a particular field. A number of field classes are
provided by FormHandler. You can customize the validation in your form on a
per field basis, but validation that will be used for more than one field
might be more easily handled in a custom field class.

In the templates the fields are accessed with C< form.field('name') >.
Field errors are in C<< $field->errors >>.

If the 'field_name_space' is not set, field will be loaded from the
HTML::FormHandler::Field name space. If you provide a 'field_name_space'
it will be searched before FormHandler. If you want to explicitly list the
field's package, prefix it with a plus sign. The field_name_space plus the
default name spaces 'HTML::FormHandler::Field' and 'HTML::FormHandlerX::Field'
will be searched for fields.

    has '+field_name_space' => ( default => 'MyApp::Form::Field' );
    has_field 'name' => ( type => 'Text' ); # HTML::FormHandler::Field::Text
    has_field 'name' => ( type => '+My::FieldType' ); # My::Fieldtype
    has_field 'foo'  => ( type => +Foo' );  # MyApp::Form::Field::Foo
      or
    has_field 'foo'  => ( type => 'Foo' );  # MyApp::Form::Field::Foo


The most basic type is "Text", which is usually a 'text' HTML element and
a string data type. (If the type of a field is not specified, it will be set to
'Text'.)  A "Select" field type is an HTML form element, and validates against
the list of values provided in the 'options'. A "Multiple" type is like "Select"
but it allows selecting more than one value at a time.

Many field classes contain only a list of constraints and transformations
to apply. Some use the 'validate' method, which is called after the actions
are applied. Some build a custom select list using 'build_options'.

There are two rough categories of Field classes: those that do extra processing
and those that are simple validators. The 'Compound', 'Repeatable', and
'Select' fields are fields that are functional.

=head1 Field names

The standard way to use FormHandler is with field names that match your
database accessors. If you want to prepend the HTML field names with a
name plus dot, you can set the form 'name' and use the 'html_prefix'
flag. "$name." will be stripped from the beginning of the HTML fields
before processing by HFH, and will be added back in 'fif'. The field's
'html_name' convenience attribute will return this name for use in templates.

If you want the FormHandler field name to be different than the
database accessor, set 'accessor' on your fields. (It defaults to the field
name). You could then use any name that you want for your field.

There are a number of name related field attributes. The 'name' is
the name used to identify this particular field in this fields array.
The 'full_name' is includes the names of all parents of this field,
like 'address.street.streetname'. The 'html_name' is the same as the
'full_name' unless you have set the 'html_prefix' flag, in which case
it includes the form name: 'myform.address.street.streetname'.

To retrieve a field by name, you can use either the full_name or a
chain: C<< $form->field('address')->field('street')->field('streetname') >>
or: C<< $form->field('address.street.streetname') >>.

=head1 Creating custom fields

Subclass a custom field from L<HTML::FormHandler::Field>, or one of the
existing subclasses. Almost everything that is done in a custom field
class can also be done in a form. The advantage of a field class
is that it can simplify declaration of often-repeated sets of attributes.

The simplest subclasses contain only a 'validate' routine or an 'apply' attribute,
which is called by the base Field class from 'process'. Look at
L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Email>, for example.

If the field's value will be an object instead of a simple scalar, such
as a DateTime and you want to use the transformed value to fill in the
form, then you will also need a deflation or field class 'deflate' method
to reformat the object into a form suitable for an HTML form field.

Some custom fields might only require setting certain attributes to
defaults, such as the L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Hour> field, which
set 'range_start' to 0 and 'range_end' to 23. A 'select' field might
override the 'build_options' builder for the 'options' array, like
L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::IntRange>. A field may add additional
attributes, such as 'label_format' in L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::IntRange>,
or set the 'required' message.

An alternative to new field classes for many field validations might
be roles with collections of validations.

=head1 Fields supplied by FormHandler

=head2 Basic Fields

Although there are a lot of fields provided (probably too many) a lot of them
are "convenience" fields or "name" fields, where the main benefit is
that the field type is a name that gives the main purpose of the field.
Most of these fields could be replaced by a basic field with a bit of validation
or some select options. A few of the fields are special purpose fields
that won't be used very often.

The fields in this section are the basic fields, the commonly used fields
that will be most often used in a form.

=head3 Text

A string data type that will be formatted as an HTML text field.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Text>

=head3 Select

A field formatted as a select elememnt.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Select>

=head3 Checkbox

A field formatted as a checkbox.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Checkbox>

=head3 Hidden

A hidden field.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Hidden>

=head3 Password

A password field. The value is not re-displayed.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Password>

=head3 Textarea

A textarea field.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Textarea>

=head3 Upload

A file upload field that takes a filehandle or a Catalyst upload object.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Upload>

=head3 Submit

A submit submit field.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Submit>

=head3 Reset

A reset field.

L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Reset>

=head2 Complex Fields (Compound and Repeatable)

These fields are complex fields which contain a fair amount of
special code. They do not map to a single HTML element; they contain
multiple subfields.

=head3 Compound

A compound field is a field that has sub-fields. Compound fields can be
created in two ways: 1) using a field class, 2) by declaration.

To create a compound field class, you must extend
L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Compound> and use L<HTML::FormHandler::Moose> to
allow declaring fields:

  package MyApp::Field::Duration;

  use HTML::FormHandler::Moose;
  extends 'HTML::FormHandler::Field::Compound';

  has_field 'month' => (type => 'Integer');
  has_field 'day' => ( type => 'Integer' );
  has_field 'minutes' => ( type => 'Integer' );

Then in the form:

  has_field 'my_duration' => ( type => '+Duration' );

To create a compound field by declaration, declare the containing
compound field and subfields, prefixing the subfield names
with the name of the containing compound field plus a dot:

   package MyApp::Form;

   use HTML::FormHandler::Moose;
   extends 'HTML::FormHandler';

   has_field 'duration' => ( type => 'Compound' );
   has_field 'duration.month' => ( type => 'Integer' );
   has_field 'duration.day' => ( type => 'Integer' );
   has_field 'duration.year' => ( type => 'Integer' );

In an HTML form the name of the field must be the complete name
with dots. The 'html_name' field attribute can be used to get
this name, C<< $field->html_name >>.

A compound field can be used for a database relation that will have only
one row (belongs_to or has_one). If the relation has a compound primary
key, you may need to provide the primary key columns, either through
hidden fields or by setting them in the C<< $form->value >> has before
'update_model' is called.

See also L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Compound>.

=head3 Repeatable

Repeatable fields are used for arrays of compound fields.


   has_field 'addresses' => ( type => 'Repeatable' );
   has_field 'addresses.address_id' => ( type => 'PrimaryKey' );
   has_field 'addresses.street';
   has_field 'addresses.city';
   has_field 'addresses.country' => ( type => 'Select' );

The arrays will be built from arrays passed in the params, or from
related ('has_many') rows in the database.

It is also used for arrays of single fields using the 'contains' keyword:

  has_field 'tags' => ( type => 'Repeatable' );
  has_field 'tags.contains' => ( type => '+Tag' );

See L<HTML::FormHandler::Field::Repeatable> for more information.
